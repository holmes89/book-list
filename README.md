# Book List
Keep track of books to read and organize them by subject

## What problem will this solve?
I tend to find a lot of different books in varying subjects that I want to read or use for projects. Often this is done through sheets of paper, open tabs, or an Amazon shopping list. I would rather have the ability to add a book by ISBN to a general collection and then add them to lists based on subject matter.
